# batch-xfdl
A tool for programatically editing and updating .xfld form documents.

XFDL Documents were used by the Department of the Army as the official e-form format. This project looks to provide an efficient tool to batch fill and manipulate XFDL documents to make life easier for the people who use them.

This project is defunct as the DoD has moved away from XFDL to fillable PDFs.
